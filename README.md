**Limit the creative**. Control what your players can do in it. Set your own rules! Don't let anything bad happen. Disable dropping items while in creative, or PvP-ing, container opening, igniting, potions, disable commands, add or remove permissions, track block placing and then disable drops from them, disable some items, or switch inventories when gamemode is changed. Everything this and more you can control with this plugin. Download is for free so give t a try!
